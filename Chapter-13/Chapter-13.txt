8. Introducing <link> element : The <link> element is used to define a bridge from one document to another which allows you to import the contents of a script or resource such as 'Stylesheet' into your HTML document.

Note : The <link> element can also be used to link different versions of a page together.

Example : <link type = "text/css" rel = "stylesheet" href = "index.css">

a) Use the link element to external resources.
b) The type of this information is "text/css" (css stylesheet).
c) The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the html file & the thing you are linking to (stylesheet).
d) The stylesheet is located at 'href'.

Note : <link> is a void element hence there is no closing tag.

11. Bullet points :

b) A typical rule consists of a selector along with one or more properties or values.
c) The selector specifies which elements the rule applies to.
d) By separating element names with commas you can select multiple elements at once.
e) The link element is used to link to an external stylesheet.

12. Is it compulsory to write style rules in a separate language?
A. It is better to provide styles in a separate language called css as css is better suited for specifying style information compared to HTML & also it handles styles for multiple pages in a much better way.

13. How many rules can be added for a single element?
A. We can add as many rules as we want for a single element. Each rule adds a new style information for that element.

14. What is the difference between text-decoration & border-bottom property?
A. They are two different styles. Where text-decoration property with the value 'underline' produces a line equal to the length of the text below that element & the border-bottom property with the value '1px solid black' color produces a line till the edge of the page below that element.

15. How many properties can be set on a particular element?
A. There are way too many properties that can be set on a particular element. We will be teaching all of those in further classes.

16. What is the advantage of adding multiple selectors in a single rule?
A. The advantage of combining common style rules together is if you have to change a rule for any of that element, you just have to change them in one rule & the other changes automatically as its combine.

17. Is it necessary to worry if we get warnings in W3C validator?
A. It is good to clear all the warnings displayed by W3C as it displays only those warnings which are related to industry standards. Having said that the validator just suggests to change and it is completely left to you to execute those changes.
