1. <table> in HTML : The <table> tag is used to define a HTML table.
A HTML table consists of the <table> element & one or more <tr>, <th> & <td> elements.

Tables give you a way to specify tabular data in your HTML, which consists of rows & columns, & at the intersection of each row & column we have a cell.

<table> element is used to start the table, <tr> element defines a table row, <th> element defines a table header & the <td> element defines the table cell.

2. Creating a table with HTML : 
a) Create a new file in Brackets & save it as index.html.
b) Open index.html  file & type : 

<!doctype html>
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Table of States & Capitals</title>
    </head>
    <body>
            <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>State</th>
                    <th>Capital</th>
                    <th>Population</th>
                    <th>Area(Km<sup>2</sup>)</th> 
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Karnataka</td>
                    <td>Bengaluru</td>
                    <td>6,10,95,297</td>
                    <td>1,91,791</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Andhra Pradesh</td>
                    <td >Hyderabad</td>
                    <td>4,97,80,77</td>
                    <td>1,60,205</td>
                </tr>


                <tr>
                    <td>Telangana</td>
                    <td>Hyderabad</td>
                    <td>3,50,03,674</td>
                    <td>1,12,077</td>
                </tr>


                <tr>
                    <td>Kerela</td>
                    <td>Thiruvananthapuram</td>
                    <td>3,34,06,061</td>
                    <td>38,852</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Tamil Nadu</td>
                    <td>Chennai</td>
                    <td>7,21,47,030</td>
                    <td>1,30,060</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Punjab</td>
                    <td>Chandigarh</td>
                    <td>2,77,04,236</td>
                    <td>50,362</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Haryana</td>
                    <td>Chandigarh</td>
                    <td>2,81,07,999</td>
                    <td>44,212</td>
                </tr>

            </table>
    </body>
</html>
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.

3. Adding style to the table :
a) Create a new folder 'css'.
b) Create a new file in brackets & save it as index.css inside the css folder.
c) Open index.css file & type :
		table {
			border : 2px solid black;
		  }
d) Save the file.
e) Cam pans to index.html file.
f) Add : <link type = "text/css" rel = "stylesheet" href = "css/index.css">
g) Save the file.
h) Show the output & explain.

4. 
a) Open index.css file.
b) Add : th,td {
		border : 1px dashed black;
		}
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.(explain about two separate borders)
e) Cam pans to index.css file.
f) Add : table {
		border-collapse : collapse;
	    }
g) Save the file.
h) Show the output & explain.

5. For script : Now we have got a small table & it doesn't look good. Lets make it large by giving width & height.

6. 
a) Open index.html file.
b) Cam focus on <table> & add :
		<table width = "800" height = "600">
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.
e) Open index.css file.
f) Add : 
	table {
		margin-left : 20px;
		margin-right : 20px;
		text-align : center;
	  }

        th,td { font-size : 20px; }
g) Save the file.
h) Show the output & explain.

7. For script : Lets place our table at center of the page by adding a <div> around <table>.

8.
a) Open index.html file.
b) Add : 
	<div id = "main-table">
		<table width = "800" height = "600">
		-----------------------------------
		</table>
	</div>
c) Save the file.
d) Open index.css file.
e) Add :
	#main-table {
		position : absolute;
		top : 110px;
		left : 400px;
	  }
f) Save the  file.
g) Show the output & explain.

9. 
a) Open index.css file.

	body { background-color : #f5f5dc; }
	th { background-color : #f0bdf0; }
	td { background-color : #f5dcf5; }
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.

10. Adding a Caption : The <caption> element is used to provide additional information about the table.
By default, most browsers display the caption above the table.
If you dont like the default location of the caption, you can use css to re-position it to the bottom.

a) Open index.html file.
b) Add : <table width = "800" height = "600">
	<caption>List of States with its Capital & Population</caption>
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	</table>
c) Save the file.
d) Open index.css file.
e) Add : caption { 
	font-size : 35px;
	font-family : cursive;
	font-weight : bold;
	padding-bottom : 15px;
   }
f) Save the file.
g) Show the output & explain.

11. Bullet points :
a) HTML tables are used to structure tabular data.
b) Use the HTML table elements <table>, <tr>, <th> & <td> together to create a table.
c) The <table> element defines & surrounds the entire table.
d) Tables are defined in rows, using the <tr> element.
e) Each row contains one or more data cells, defined with the <td> element.
f) Use the <th> element for data cells that are row or column headings.
g) Tables are laid out in a grid. Each row corresponds to a <tr>-----</tr> row in your HTML & each column corresponds to the <td>-----</td> content within the rows.
h) You can provide additional information about your tables with the <caption> element.
i) border-collapse is a special CSS property for tables that allows you to combine cell borders into one border for a cleaner look.

12. Why isn't there a table column element? That seems pretty important.
A. The designers of HTML decided to let you specify tables by row, rather than by column. But notice that by specifying each row's <td> elements, you are implicitly specifying each column anyway.

13. What happens if I have a row that doesn't have enough elements? In other words, I have got fewer things than the number of columns in the table?
A. The easiest way to deal with that is to just leave the content of the data cell empty; In other words, you write <td></td>. If you leave out the data cell, then the table won't line up properly, so all the data cells have to be there, even if they are empty.

14. Isn't a table all about presentation? What happened to presentation vs structure?
A. Not really. With tables, you are specifying the relationship between tabular data items. We will use css to alter the presentation of the table.

15. How do HTML tables relate to css table display?
A. HTML tables allows you to specify the structure of a table using markup while css table display give you a way to display block-level elements in a table-like presentation. Think about it this way, when you really need to create tabular data in a page, use tables; However, when you just need to make use of a table-like presentation with other types of content, then you can use a css table display layout.

16. You said border spacing is defined for the entire table, so I can't set a margin for an individual table cell?
A. Right. Table cells don't have margins; What they have is spacing around their borders, & this spacing is set for the entire table. You can't control the border spacing of each table cell separately.

17. Well, is there any way to have different border spacing on the vertical than I have on the horizontal? That seems useful.
A. You sure can. You can specify your border spacing like this : 
	border-spacing : 10px 30px;
That sets 10px of horizontal border space & 30px of vertical border space.
