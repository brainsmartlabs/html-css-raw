1. Introduction to HTML5 : HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring & presenting content on the World Wide Web(WWW).
It is the fifth & current major version of the HTML standard & was published in 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C).
The new basic HTML5 elements are :
a) <header>
b) <footer>
c) <time>
d) <nav>
e) <section>

2. 
a) <header> : The HTML <header> element represents typically a group of introductory contents. It may contain some heading elements & also elements like a logo or an image etc. It is a replacement for <div id = "header">.
b) <footer> : The HTML <footer> element is used to define the footer of a HTML document or section. Footers usually contain information such as the author of the document, information related to copyrights & links to related documnts. It is a replacement for <div id = "footer">.
c) <time> : The HTML <time> element is used to represent the 'datetime' attribute, which translates dates into machine-readable format.
d) <nav> : The HTML <nav> element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents.
e) <section> : The <section> element represents a generic section of a document or an application.

8. Bullet Points :
a) HTML5 added several new elements to HTML.
b) <section> is for grouping related content.
c) <nav> is for grouping site navigation links.
d) <header> groups content such as headings & logos that typically go at the top of a page or section.
e) <footer> groups content such as document imformation & copyright that typically go at the bottom of a page or a section.
f) <time> is also a new element in HTML5. It is used to markup times & dates.
g) <div> is still used for structure. It is often used to group elements together for styling purposes or to create structure for content that doesn't fit into one of the new structure-related elements in HTML5.

9. What is the difference between a <section> & a <div>?
A. <div> is used to add an element, so you can style the page whereas <section> is used to add an element to markup content that forms a well defined section of related content.

10. Should we use <header> only when we have got more than one thing to put in it? What if we have only got one heading & nothing else?
A. You can use <header> even if you have only one heading to put in it. The <header> element provides extra semantic meaning that separates the header of a page or a section from the rest of the content. However, its not required that you always put your heading content in a <header> element.

11. We are doing a lot of work to add elements to the page, & it looks exactly the same as it did before. Tell me again what all this is getting me?
A. We have replaced a few elements & added a few elements, & in the process, we have added a lot of meaning to our pages. The browser, search engines & applications for building webpages, can- if they want- be a lot smarter about how they handle different parts of your page. & your page is easier for you, & other web developers, to read. Eventhough your page looks the same, its a lot more meaningful under the covers.

12. Should every <section> & every <article> always have a <header>?
A. Most of the time, your <section>s & <article>s will have a <header>, or atleast a heading. Think about it : Content within an <article> element can be reused elsewhere, so chances are, that content will need a header for discriptive for introduction purposes. Likewise, content with a <section> element is a group of related content in your page, so it will typically have some kind of header to separate & introduce that section of content.
