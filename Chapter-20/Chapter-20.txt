Chapter-20

1. <span> in HTML : The <span> tag is used to group inline elements in a document for styling purpose.

<span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element, whereas a <span> is an inline element.

Example : <p>Right place for<span>Bright future</span> </p> (in HTML file).

span {font-weight : bold;} (in CSS file)

2. Adding spans to our faculty.html page in topper-tutorials folder : 

a) Open faculty.html file.
b) Add : <h4><span class = "designation"> Dr. </span> <span class = "name"> Rajkumar</span></h4>
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.
e) Open index.css file.
f) Add : .designation {font-style : italic;}
.name {font-weight : bolder;}
g) Save the file.
h) Cam pans to index.html file.
i) Show the output & explain. (Explain about different styles in an inline element)
j) Cam pans to faculty.html file.
k) Add : <h4><span class = "designation"> Prof. </span> <span class = "name"> Shankarnag</span></h4>
l) Save the file.
m) Cam pans to index.html file.
n) Show the output & explain.
o) Same process repeats for all <h4> elements in faculty.html

3. Introducing pseudo-classes : A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements.

A pseudo-class acts like a class, but it is not an actual class.

Example : 

:visited - Represents a link that the user has already visited.
:link - Represents a link that has not yet been visited.
:hover - It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the mouse pointer.

4. Adding pseudo-classes to our topper-tutorials webpage : 

a) Open index.html file & show the output (Explain about the default color of the link)
b) Open index.css file.
c) Add : 
a:link{color : #280ba3;}
d) Save the file.
e) Open index.html file.
f) Show the output & explain. (The above rule applies color to unvisited links)

5. Adding pseudo-class :visited

a) index.html output page is present.
b) Click on the link our faculty.
c) Click on the link Back to home.
d) Explain about the default color of the visited link.
e) Open index.css file
f) Add :
a:visited{color : #275809;}
g) Save the file.
h) Open index.html file.
i) Show the output.
j) Click on the link our faculty.
k) Click on the link Back to home.
l) Explain about the changed color of the visited link our faculty.

6. Adding pseudo-class :hover

a) index.html output page is present.
b) Place the mouse pointer on the link our faculty.
c) Explain about no color change.
d) Open index.css file.

a:hover{color : #cc0a0a;}
f) Save the file.
g) Open index.html file.
h) Show the output.
i) Place the mouse pointer of the link out faculty.
j) Explain about the color change.

7. Bullet points :

a) The <span> in inline element is similar to the <div> element : It is used to group together related inline elements & text.
b) Just like <div>, you can add <span> elements to classes or give <span> elements unique ids to style them. 
c) You can style each states of <a> element separatly with pseudo-classes. The pseudo-classes are used most often with the <a> element are :link for unvisited links, :visited for visited links & :hover for the hover state.
d) Additional pseudo-classes are - :active, :focus, :first-child & :last child etc.

8. When do i use a <span> rather than another inline element like <em> or <strong>?
A. If what you really want is to change the style of certain words, then you should use a <span> & put your <span> elements into appropriate classes to group them & style them together.

9. Can i set property like width on <span> elements?
A. You can set the width of inline elements like <span>, <em> etc. But you won't notice any effect until you positioned them.

10. What happens if i just style the <a> element like a normal element? Like : a{color : red;}
A. You certainly can do that, but then your links will look the same in all states, which makes your  links less user-friendly.

11. Can't my links be in multiple states at the same time? For instance, my link could be visited, have the mouse hovering over it & the user could be actively cliking on it all at once.
A. They sure can. You determind which style is applied by the ordering of your rules. So, the right ordering is generally considered to be : link, visited, hover, focus & then active. If you use that ordering, you will get the results you expect.
