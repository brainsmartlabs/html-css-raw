Chapter-04

1. Introducing <a> tag : An Anchor tag (<a>) is used to create a hyper text link which connects two web pages with one another.

The content of an <a> tag element will become a clickable link on our web page.
Ex : <a href = "file name.html">label</a> (arrow with text - attribute name, double quotes, attribute value)

a) href is an attribute in our <a> tag which is to specify the destination of the given hyper link.
b) It loads the file which is linked to our main file.
c) It is displayed as clickable link on our web page.

Note : Any hyper link in HTML is by default displayed with an underline by our browser on the web page.

2. Understanding attributes : An attribute is a part of a html element which provides additional information about that particular element.

Different types of attributes : 

a) <style type = "text/css"> : The 'type' attribute here specifies which style language we are using.
b) <img src = "pani-puri.jpg"> : The 'src' attribute here specifies the file name & its location of the picture which is to be displayed on our web page using the <img> tag.
c) <a href = "helloworld.html"> : The 'href' attribute here specifies the browser an exact destination of the hyper link which is enclosed by an <a> tag.

3. Bullet points : 

a) Attribute are used to customise an element.
b) href is nothing but 'hypertext reference'.
c) When a link is clicked it is the href which tells the browser which file has to be loaded.
d) href is generally used inside an <a> tag.
e) A hypertext refernce is nothing but a resource that available on the internet or in your Pc/Server.
f) Usually resource is a web page or a PDF document.
