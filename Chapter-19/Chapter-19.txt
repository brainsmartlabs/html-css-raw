1. <div> tag in html : The <div> tag defines a division or a section in a html document, which is used to group together html elements & apply css styles to many element at once.

Example : (ammus-kitchen latest output)

Note : Here we have taken ammus kitchen webpage to show the example of <div> tag & we have divided that page into many sections. You can do the same for any of your webpages.

a) The header division gets highlighted, which contains <img> & <h1>.
b) Aloo paratha division gets highlighted, which contains <h1>, <img>, <p>, paratha ingredients division & paratha preparation division.
c) Paratha ingredients division gets highlighted, which contains <h4> & <ol>.
d) Paratha preparation division gets highlighted, which contains <h4> & <ul>.
e) The same process repeats till the end.

6. Bullet points : 

a) <div> elements are used to group related elements together into logical sections.
b) Creating logical sections can help to identify the main content area, header & footer of your page.
c) Use nested <div> elements to add further structure to your files.
d) The width property sets the width of the content area of an element.
e) The total width of an element is the width of the content area, plus the width of padding, border & margin you add.
f) Text-align is a property for block elements that aligns all inline content in the block element to the center, right or to the left of that element.
g) You can use descendant selectors to select elements nested within other elements.


7. <div> acts like a container to keep all elements together?
A. Yes. <div> element not only acts as logical container that you can use to hold a bunch of related elements together, but when your style <div> element & start using them for positioning, they act as graphical containers too.

8. Beyond the structure i am already putting into my pages with headings & paragraphs and so on, should i also be adding a higher level of structure with <div>s ? 
A. Yes and No. You want to add structure where it has a real purpose, but don't add structure for the sake of it. Always keep your structure as simple as possible.

9. If i don't set the width of an element, then where does the width come from?
A. The default width for a block element is "auto", which means that it will expand to fill whatever space is available.

10. What if i don't have any margin, padding or borders?
A. Then your content gets to use the entire width of the box.

11. What are the different ways i can specify width?
A. You can specify width in pixels or percentage.

12. What about the height property?
A. In general, the height of an element is kept as default which is auto & the browser expands the content area vertically, so that all the content is visible.

13. Descendant usually means child, grandchild, great-grandchild. Hence we are just selecting the child descendants right?
A. The selector "#faculties h4" means any descendants of faculties. So the <h4> could be a direct child of the <div> or nested inside an another <div> and so on. So descendant selector selects any <h4> nested inside an element, no matter how deeply it is nested.

14. Do you ever put a <div> in a class instead of giving it an id?
A. An element can have an id & be in one or more classes at the same time, so the choice is not mutually exclusive. And, yes, there are many times you create <div> & place them into classes.

15. Is there a way to select a direct child?
A. Yes. For example you could use "#faculties h4" to select <h4> only if it is the direct child of an element with an id of "faculties".
