a) The 'lang' attribute is used along with <html> tag to specify the language of html page.
b) By following the standards of html, your pages will be displayed quicker & with fewer differences between different browsers. 
c) The 'alt' attribute is compulsory according to latest html standards.

9. What is the need of an 'alt' attribute?
A. 'alt' attribute is compulsory according to the html standards as it displays a meaningful description in the place of an image if the browser is unable to load that image.

10. What are the consequences of not declaring the 'doctype' in a HTML page?
A. If we do not declare 'doctype' in html page the browser will not understand that we are using html 5 version & there are chances of different browser displaying the webpage in different ways.

11. Even though we have added the 'doctype' & 'meta' tag the page still looks the same why?
A. The 'doctype' tag specifies to the browser that the developer is using HTML 5 version & 'meta' tag is used for character encoding hence there is no change in the webpage.
