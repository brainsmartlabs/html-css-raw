CHAPTER-22

1.Flow in HTML : Flow is actually what the browser uses to layout a page of HTML elements.

For block element, it puts a linebreak between each line. The first element in a document is displayed first, then a linebreak, followed by the second element, then a linebreak & so on.

Example diagram (refer textbook)

Inline elements are flowed next to eachother horizontally from top left to bottom right.

Example diagram (refer textbook)

2.Margins for Inline & Block element : 

The browser treats margins differently for inline & block element.

For Inline elements : Place two inline elements next to eachother, if the left element has a margin of 10px & the right has a margin of 20px then there will be 30px of space between two elements.

Example diagram (refer textbook)

For Block elements : Place two block elements on top of eachother. The top element's bottom margin is 10px & the bottom element's top margin is 20px. Then the browser collapses their shared margins together & the height of the collapsed margin is the height of the largest margin.

Example diagram (refer textbook)

3.Introducing Float property : CSS float property specifies how an element should float in a webpage.

The Float property has the following values : 
a) left : The element floats to the left of its container.
b) right : The element floats to the right of its container.
c) none : The element does not float.
d) inherit : The element inherits the float value of its parent.

4.Adding Float property to our ammu's kitchen webpage : 

a) Open index.html page
b) put the entire aloo paratha content inside : <div id = "aloo_paratha">
c) put the aloo paratha ingredients inside : <div id = "paratha_ingredients">
d) put the aloo paratha preparation inside : <div id = "paratha_preparation">
e) save
 
 <div id = "aloo_paratha">

14.Bullet Points
a) Browsers place elements in a page using Flow.
b) Block elements flow from top to bottom, with a linebreak between elements. By default, each block element takes up the entire width of the browser window.
c) Inline elements flow inside a block element from the top left to the bottom right. If more than one line is needed, the browser creates a new line & expands the containing block element vertically to contain the inline elements.
d) Floated elements are taken out of the normal flow & placed to the left or right.
e) Floated elements sit on top of block elements & dont affect their flow. However, the inline content respects the boundaries of a floated element and flows around it.
f) The clear Property is used to specify that no floated elements can be on the left or right or both of a block element. A block element with clear set will move down until it is free of the block element on its side.
g) A floated element must have a specific width set to a value other than auto.

15.If i have a block element with a zero margin, & a block element below it with a top margin of 20, the margin between them would end up being 20?
A. Right. If one of the margins is bigger, then the margin becomes the larger of the two, even if one margin is zero. But if the margins are the same, say, 10px then they just get collapsed together to 10px total.

16.Can inline elements really have margins?
A. They sure can, although you will find that you often dont set the margins of inline elements. The one exception is images. It is very common to not only set margins but also borders & padding on images.

17. What if i have one element nested inside another & they both have margins? Can they collapse?
A. Yes, that can happen. whenever you have two vertical margins touching, they will collapse, even if one element is nested the other. Notice that if the outer element has a border, the margins will never touch, so they wont collapse. But if you remove the border, they will.

18. Can i float to the center?
A. No, css only allows you to float an element to the left or right. But if you think about it, If you were to float to the center, then the inline content under the floated element would have to be flowed around both sides of your element, which would be quite tricky to get to work in a browser.

19. Do margins collapse on floated elements?
A. No, they dont. Unlike block elements that are flowed on the page, floated elements are just, well, floated. In other words, the margins of floated elements are not acctually touching the margins of the elements in the normal flow, so they cant be collapsed. But, this raises a good point, & identifies a common error in layouts. 

20. Can i float an Inline element?
A. Yes, you suree can. The best example & a common one is to float images. Give it a try, float an image left or right in a paragraph & you will see your text flow around it. Dont forget to add padding ot give the image a little room, & possibly a border. You can also float any other inline element you like, but its not commonly done.
