h) Cam pans to <a href = "faculty.html">Our faculty</a> circle on it.
i) Cam pans down & foucus on <a href = "location.html">Locate Us</a> circle on it & zoom back.

4. Introduction to relative path : A relative path is link that refers to the location which points to other files on our website relative to the web page from which we are linking. 

There are two different ways to represent a relative path : 

a) <a href = "folder name/file name.html">Label</a> : '/' Which represents seperation, Label it can be word or an image that you see on web page by default it is underlined.

b) <a href = "../file name.html">Label</a> : '..' represents a root folder.

Note : To figure out a relative path for your links you have to start from the page that has the link & then you trace a path through your folders & till you find the file that you need to point to.

11. Bullet points : 

a) '..' represents root folder use to link your files that's one folder above the file your linking from.
b) '/' (forward slash) is use for seperation.
c) We will get a broken image on our web page, when the path to an image is incorrect.
d) Don't use spaces in the file name & folder names you choose for your website.
e) It's good idea to organise your website folder structure before building your website, so there is no need of changing a bunch of paths later when the website grows.

12. Mini Assignment : Create a new folder called images to our chit-chat-corner.html & move all the images to images folder, Add a relative path for our chit-chat-corner.html

13. What is the use of '..' ?
A. We use '..' when we need to tell the browser that the file which we are linking is in the root folder.

14. What do you do if you need to go up two folders instead of just one?
A. We use '../..' to go up two folders instead of just one folder.

15. Is there a limit to how far up we can go?
A. We can go up until we are at the root of our website. In our example the root was topper-tutorials folder so we could only go up as far as topper-tutorials folder.

16.
 Our operating system uses '/' (forward slash) as a seperator can we use a '\' (back slash) ?
A. No, Don't use '\' (back slash) because various operating system use different files seperators but when it comes to web browser we pick up a common seperator that is '/' (forward slash) for our html, Whether you use Mac, Windows or Linux operating system. 

17. Since you have folder for your images why not have another one called "html" & put all the HTML in that folder?
A.  Yes you can create folder called as HTML, But we don't recommend that as what we have shown is a Industry Standard which is followed.

18. Why can't we have images folder in each other folder, Like "address" & "staff"?
A.  As keeping all the images in the root folder itself is an industry standard we cannot have images folder in other folders like "address" & "staff".

19. Is there a limit to how far down we can go?
A.  In general you can go down how much ever you want to but in reality you can go down till the last branch folder. But we don't recommend that when you have that many folder levels, It means your website organization is too complicated.
