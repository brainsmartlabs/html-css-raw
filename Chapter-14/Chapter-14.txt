Chapter-14

1. Introducing class attribute : The class attribute sepcifies the class name of a particular element.
It is primarily used to point to a particular class in a HTML file.

Example : <p class = "vision"> (in HTML file)

p.vision {
		color : maroon;
}  (in css file)

Note : We can use save class name to multiple class attributes.

2. Adding class attribute to index.html : (type ani)

a) Open index.html file.
b) Cam focus on first paragraph & add <p class = "vision"> </p>
c) Cam focus on second paragraph & add <p class = "vision"> </p>
d) Cam focus on third paragraph & add <p class = "faculty"> </p>

3. Creating a class selector in css : (type ani)

p.vision {
		color : #363636;
}

p.faculty{
    font-weight: bold;
}

Open index.html file show the output & explain the styles of three paragraphs

4. Understanding inheritance in html : 

a) HTML appears with sparkle effect.
b) Draw two lines & head along with body appears.
c) Draw two lines & title along with link appears.
d) Draw six lines from body & image, h2, p, p, h3 & p appears.
e) Draw two lines from last p & a, a appears. 
f) Show the output & explain the inherited properties from body to all the below elements & p to both a elements.

5. Overriding the inheritance:
body{ 
   	 font-family:sans-serif;
    }

h2,h3{
    font-family: serif;

}

a) The font-family property is set in the body rule, so every element inside the body inherit the sans-serif property.
b) To override the font-family property in h2 & h3, inherited from body, add a new rule with the font-family property value set to serif.

6. Bullet points :

a) Many properties are inherited. For instance if a property that is inherited is set for the <body> element, all the <body>'s child element will inherit it.
b) You can always override properties that are inherited by creating a more specific rule for the element you would like to change.
c) Use the class attribute to add elements to a class.
d) Use a "." between the element name & class name to select a specific element in that class.
e) Use ".classname" to select any elements that belong to the class.
f) You can validate your css using the W3C validator at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.

7. Which rule does the browser apply when we override an inherited value?
A. The browser applies the most specific rule when we override an inherited value 
For example : body{ 
    border: 4px double #379a33;
    padding: 30px;
    margin-left: 10%;
    margin-right: 10%;
    font-size: 20px;
    font-family:sans-serif;
    background-color:lavender;
}

p.faculty{
    font-weight: bold;
}

In the above scenario the browser applies the second rule as it is more specific than the first rule.

8. Which are the rules that the child tag inherits from the parent tag?
A. In genral the child tags inherit the font-color, the font-family and other font related rules (font-size, font-weight etc...)
