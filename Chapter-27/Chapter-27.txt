1. Introducing 'rowspan' attribute : The rowspan attribute in HTML specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
The rowspan attribute can be used in <th> & <td> elements.

Example : <th rowspan = "2">---------</th>
	  <td rowspan = "3">---------</td>

2. Introducing 'colspan' attribute : The colspan attribute in HTML specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
Similar to the rowspan the colspan attribute can be used in <th> & <td> elements.

Example : <th colspan = "2">---------</th>
	  <td colspan = "3">---------</td>

3. Adding rowspan attribute to our index.html
a) Open index.html file.
b) Cam focus on 3rd row.
c) Add : <td rowspan = "2">Hyderabad</td>.
d) Save the file.
e) Show the output & explain.
f) Cam pans to index.html file.
g) Cam focus on 7th row.
h) Add : <td rowspan = "2">Chandigarh</td>.
i) Save the file.
j) Show the output & explain.

4. Nested tables in HTML : A Nested Table is one table placed inside of another, where the larger table functions as a container for the smaller one.
By default, the Nested Table carry the same styles of the main table, until we specifically add the styles for Nested Table.
Nested Tables in HTML are straightforward, all we need to do is put another <table> element inside a <td> to create the same.

5. Adding a Nested table to our existing table : 
a) Open index.html file.
b) Cam focus on 3rd row.
c) Add : 
	<td>
	    <table>
		<tr>
		    <th>AP</th>
		    <td>4,97,80,777</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <th>Hyderabad</th>
		    <td>97,57,145</td>
		</tr>
	    </table>
	</td>
d) Save the file.
e) Show the output & explain.

6. Adding styles for the Nested Table :
a) Open index.css file.
b) Add :
	table table {
		width : 250px;
		height : 80px;
	    }
c) Save the file.
d) Show the output & explain.
e) Cam pans to index.css file.
f) Add : 
	table table {
		margin-left : 50px;
	   }
g) Save the file.
h) Show the output & explain.

7. Mini Assignment : Create a table in Topper Tutorials webpage, which contains the following data

(draw a table with headings as seen in topper-tutorials page)

8. Mini Assignment : Add styles for the created table.

9. Bullet Points :
a) If you have no data for a data cell, put no content into the <td> element. You need to use a <td>.....</td> element to maintain the alignment of the table.
b) If your data cell needs to span multiple rows or columns, we can use the rowspan or colspan attributes of the <td> element.
c) You can nest tables within tables by placing the <table> element & all its content inside a data cell.

10. You said you can have table data span columns too?
A. You sure can. Just add a colspan attribute to your <td> element & specify the number of columns. Unlike the rowspan, when you span columns, you remove table data elements that are in the same row.

11. Can I have a colspan & rowspan in the same <td>?
A. You sure can. Just make sure you adjust the other <td>s in the table to account for both the row & column spans. In other words you will need to remove the corresponding number of <td>s from the same row, & from the column.

12. Do you really think these rowspans look better?
A. Well, they certainly reduce the amount of information in the table, which is usually a good thing. &, if you look at a few tables out there in the real world, you will find that rowspans & colspans are quite commom, so its great to be able to do them in HTML. But if you liked the table better before feel free to change your HTML & go back to the previous version.
